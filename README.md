# RGB LED Ring Small
### This is the official repository of the RGB LED Ring Small!
### Available on my [DuPPa Store!](https://www.duppa.net/shop/rgb-led-ring-small/) or [Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/25812/)!

The RGB LED Ring Small is an accessory of the rotary encoder.
The shaft  of the encoder can be insert in the center hole of the board. It support both the normal rotary encoder and the RGB encoder.

There are 24 RGB LED disposed in a circle with a 30mm diameter. In total there are 72 LEDs.
Each single LED can be controller with 256 step, then each RGB LED are encoded with the 888 format.
The controller is the [ IS31FL3746](https://www.lumissil.com/assets/pdf/core/IS31FL3746A_DS.pdf)
